What do I want

1. Timestamp counter in the bottom left!
2. Total number of views via a counter!
3. Obvi all code ported over to React...

the place where i did the tutorial is: github.com/samerbuna/efficient-react

we can do `npm run eject` to download all scripts locally. Copy all configs and scripts locally to the project
npx create-react-app <app-name>

Success! Created md-game-center at /Users/matt20d/Desktop/github_repos/games/platform-game/md-game-center
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd md-game-center
  npm start
